### how to add another origin url in git for github on linux machine and switch between the first and second ?

To add another origin URL in Git and switch between the first and second on a Linux machine, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Check your current remotes
First, see what remotes you currently have by running:

bash
Copy
git remote -v
This will show the current URLs associated with your remotes (usually, youâ€™ll see something like origin with a URL).

Step 2: Add a new remote
To add a second remote (let's say you want to add a second remote named second-origin), use this command:

bash
Copy
git remote add second-origin https://github.com/username/second-repository.git
Make sure to replace https://github.com/username/second-repository.git with the actual URL of your second GitHub repository.

Step 3: Verify the remotes
To verify both the remotes are added successfully, run:

bash
Copy
git remote -v
You should see both origin and second-origin listed, each with their respective URLs.

Step 4: Switch between remotes
When you want to push or pull from a specific remote, use the following commands:

To push to origin:
bash
Copy
git push origin main
To push to second-origin:
bash
Copy
git push second-origin main
Make sure to replace main with the appropriate branch name if you're working with a different branch.

Step 5: Change the URL of an existing remote
If you want to change the URL of an existing remote (e.g., change origin), use:

bash
Copy
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/new-repository.git
Step 6: Remove a remote (if needed)
If you want to remove a remote that you no longer need, use:

bash
Copy
git remote remove second-origin
This will remove the second-origin remote.
